{"question_id": "testmini_0", "prompt": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring a floating-point number with one decimal place and provide the final value, e.g., 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, at the end.\nQuestion: When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?", "text": "The spring force is given by the spring constant $k$ multiplied by the displacement $d$ of the spring.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design. Then, he tested each design by measuring the distance between the road and the concert area.\nFigure: studying an architect's design.
