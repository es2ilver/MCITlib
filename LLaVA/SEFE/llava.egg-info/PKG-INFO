# [ICML 2025] SEFE: Superficial and Essential Forgetting Eliminator for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning

This is an official implementation of the paper "SEFE: Superficial and Essential Forgetting Eliminator for Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning", accepted by ICML 2025.
📝 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02486)
🤗 [CoIN-ASD Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinpeng0528/CoIN-ASD)

## Installation
Our environment is set up with CUDA 12.1. To ensure a smooth installation, it is recommended to also use CUDA 12.1.
```Shell
conda create -n sefe python=3.10 -y
conda activate sefe
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[train]"
pip install flash-attn==2.6.3 --no-build-isolation
```

## Data Organization and Structure

To obtain the original images and annotation data for CoIN, please refer to the [official CoIN repository](https://github.com/zackschen/CoIN). We organize the downloaded files in the following directory structure:

```
./playground/data/CoIN
├── ScienceQA
│   └── [Original Data of ScienceQA]
├── TextVQA
│   └── [Original Data of TextVQA]
├── ImageNet
│   └── [Original Data of ImageNet]
├── GQA
│   └── [Original Data of GQA]
├── VizWiz
│   └── [Original Data of VizWiz]
├── COCO
│   └── [Original Data of COCO]
├── OCRVQA
│   └── [Original Data of OCRVQA]
└── annotations
    ├── ScienceQA
    │   ├── train.json
    │   └── test.json
    ├── TextVQA
    │   ├── train.json
    │   └── test.json
    ├── ImageNet
    │   ├── train.json
    │   └── test.json
    ├── GQA
    │   ├── train.json
    │   └── test.json
    ├── VizWiz
    │   ├── train.json
    │   └── test.json
    ├── Grounding
    │   ├── train.json
    │   └── test.json
    ├── VQAv2
    │   ├── train.json
    │   └── test.json
    └── OCRVQA
        ├── train.json
        └── test.json
```
**Notes:**
- **Original Data Directories**: The placeholders `[Original Data of XXX]` represent the datasets (primarily images) downloaded directly from benchmarks such as ScienceQA and TextVQA. These are maintained in their default directory structures.
- **COCO Folder**: Although the CoIN benchmark does not directly include COCO, the Grounding and VQAv2 tasks utilize images from the COCO dataset. Therefore, a `COCO` folder is included.
- **Annotations**: The `train.json` and `test.json` files within the `annotations` directory contain annotations provided by CoIN or modified by our ASD. For consistency, all test sets originally named `val.json` in the CoIN repository have been renamed to `test.json`.

## CoIN-ASD
The `CoIN-ASD/prompts` directory contains all prompts used to create the CoIN-ASD benchmark. The created annotations for CoIN-ASD can be downloaded from [our HuggingFace page](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinpeng0528/CoIN-ASD). After downloading, please organize the data according to the directory structure described in the "Data Organization and Structure" section above.

Note that for training data, we provide multiple versions with different values of hyperparameter $X$. For example, when $X$ is set to $20$, the corresponding JSON file is named `train_x20.json`. To use a specific version, modify the `--data_path` parameter in the corresponding training script (`.sh` file) under `./scripts/Train/` directory.

## Pre-trained Weights
Before starting the training process, you need to download three pre-trained models:
- [Vicuna-7B-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5)
- [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336)
- [LLaVA Projector](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-mlp2x-336px-pretrain-vicuna-7b-v1.5)

We organize the downloaded models in the following directory structure:
```
./pretrained_weights
├── vicuna-7b-v1.5
├── clip-vit-large-patch14-336
└── llava-v1.5-mlp2x-336px-pretrain-vicuna-7b-v1.5
```

## Training and Evaluation
Once the data transformation is complete and structured correctly, you can initiate training by running `./scripts/Train/Train_all.sh`. This script will automatically invoke `./scripts/Eval/Eval_all.sh` after training each task to evaluate all learned tasks. For further details, please refer to the corresponding files.
